Description
-----------

The toolbox RDisk contains a Matlab-implementation for the computation of a spectral interpolation scheme on the unit disk from data samples at the nodes of one or several rhodonea curves [1]. 

Rhodonea curves are classical planar curves in the disk that have the characteristic shape of a petalled rose. Sampling along these curves gives node sets that are ideally suited to interpolate functions on the disk. The interpolation spaces are generated by a parity-modified Chebyshev-Fourier basis. One main advantage of this basis is the fact that the interpolant can be calculated efficiently by a fast Fourier transform.

- To **test** the package use **example_main.m**

- To see how the interpolation scheme can be **applied** to the black hole data from the EHT collaboration have a look at **example_blackhole.m**

- To **compare** interpolation on the rhodonea nodes with a tensor-product interpolation scheme on the disk try **example_RDvsTPD.m**

- To **plot** the Lagrange functions of the interpolation scheme use **example_lagrange.m**

- To **plot** the rhodonea varieties and the rhodonea interpolation nodes consisting of intersection and boundary points use **plot_rhodonea.m**

- To **plot** the Chebyshev-Fourier basis involved in the interpolation try **plot_basisfunction.m**
